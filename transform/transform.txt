Leonardo Da Vinci wrote backwards in what people call mirror writing style. Mirror writing is when the letters are not just in reverse order so that you have to read them backwards but the orientation of each letter is also changed.

Mirror writing can easily be deciphered by looking at it in a mirror. Itâ€™s similar to the way the word ambulance becomes legible if you see the word written on a vehicle in your rear-view mirror.
